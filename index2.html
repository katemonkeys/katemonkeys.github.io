<p>I write software here in the SF Bay Area. My day-to-day life goes like this: I code, I do crossfit, I read books. I've co-authored about 30 peer-reviewed articles on synchrotron spectroscopy of magnetic materials and this year I chair the IEEE for the bay area and Silicon Valley. On good weeks, I see the world. I like the desert, particularly Canyonlands National Park. I have fenced and played softball somewhat competitively but was thrown out of ballet. In college I was the High Priestess for the Campus Crusade for Cthulhu and have the medieval heavy weaponry to prove it. I sometimes volunteer at the Crucible, an industrial arts studio in Oakland.</p>
