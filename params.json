{"name":"Kate Jenkins","tagline":"Mechanical, inflammable, insufferable. ","body":"I write software here in the SF Bay Area. My day-to-day life goes like this: I code, I do crossfit, I read books. On good weeks, I see the world. I like the desert, particularly Canyonlands National Park. I have fenced and played softball somewhat competitively but was thrown out of both Girl Scouts and ballet. I have constructed a 12-foot Tyrannosaurus out of snow. In college I was the High Priestess for the Campus Crusade for Cthulhu and have the medieval heavy weaponry to prove it. I sometimes volunteer at the Crucible, an industrial arts studio in Oakland.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
